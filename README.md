The goal of this project is to be able to classify the genre of a song. According to Spotify Statistics taken in
December 2018, over 20,000 tracks are uploaded to Spotify alone. Thatâ€™s 1 million tracks every 6 weeks on a
single streaming service. Hence, it becomes imperative to predict the Genre of a song. The genre of the song is
one in many features that is used in building recommendation systems. A person who has heard a song of a
particular genre is more likely to listen to another song of the same genre. This project aims to provide the genre
by studying the relation of different features like dance-ability and acoustic-ness.
Through this project, we want to also understand the most optimal machine learning algorithms that can help us
predict the genre of the song with the given dataset of features.
